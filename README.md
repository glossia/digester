# Digester

`Digester` provides a set of utilities for obtaining **digests** from Elixir primitives. Digests are useful to determine if a value has changed, for example, in a cache.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `digester` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:digester, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
